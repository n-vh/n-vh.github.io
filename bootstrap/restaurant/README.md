# Restaurant

- Type of challenge: **consolidation**
- Duration: **4 days**
- Team challenge: **solo**

## Objectives

- Improve placement of elements with Bootstrap.

## The mission

Create a project in which you must realise a window web page for a restaurant. The franchise is fictive, but the type of food (burger, pizza, asian, …​) is your choice.

The website must be responsive, at least for small and medium screens. It must at least have five accessible pages: welcome, menu, pictures, restaurants and contact.

### Welcome

A page with one Jumbotron and two panels to show news (promo, events, etc…​).

### Menu

A page with the restaurant menu in the form of a grouped list with badges.

### Pictures

A page with a gallery of minimum 10 pictures and a pagination (3 photos per page).

### Restaurant

A page about the restaurants (it’s a franchise) with its addresses, a map, and different schedules.

### Contact

A page with a contact form containing the firstname, lastname, email, subject of the message (a drop-down list with multiple options), an area for the message itself and a send button with an icon. Each entry as a title in a semantically correct tag.

If you want to make an even more complex website feel free to try new things and make it as beautiful as possible.

## Instructions

- Write a good README.

- Don't use a pre-made theme.

- Mention a description and the website URL on the top of the repo.

- Credit in your README the website where the pictures are from.
