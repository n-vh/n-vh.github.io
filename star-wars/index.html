            WEB DEV STRIKES BACK
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            Nils has enrolled in BeCode, a program that teaches web development skills.<br />
            <br />
            He learned about the importance of version control in web development and was
            introduced to Git.<br />
            <br />
            One of the projects Nils worked on was to create a responsive website that
            would work well on both mobile and desktop devices.<br />
            <br />
            In addition to individual projects, Nils also had the opportunity to work on
            group projects with his classmates.<br />
            <br />
            Overall, the experience at BeCode is incredibly valuable.
